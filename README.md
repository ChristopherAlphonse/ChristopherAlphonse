# Welcome

Hi there! I'm [Christopher Alphonse](https://christopheralphonse.com), currently immersed in the world of Java and dedicated to honing my skills on LeetCode. I'm pursuing a B.S. in Software Engineering at [WGU](https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/software-engineering-bachelors-program.html#_).

Every day, I engage in technical mock interviews to sharpen my abilities, all while actively seeking summer internships or opportunities.

Additionally, I'm also reading [Eloquent JavaScript, 3rd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Eloquent-JavaScript-3rd-Introduction-Programming/dp/1593279507) through I aspire to leverage my education to its fullest potential.
