  "To make a difference and introduce new thinking and solutions to everyday issues."

<p>
I’m actively seeking an internship or entry-level role as a front-end developer or software engineer. 

My journey into tech began with self-directed learning and completing a bootcamp, which allowed me to gain hands-on experience as a contractor. 

Now, I’m taking my education to the next level by pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering to deepen my technical expertise and strengthen areas where I can grow further.

I believe in staying curious and committed to continuous growth, always striving to push technology forward.

### A little about me:

I love to garden, deep research on random things I fixate on, Skiing, and going for walks.
