### **About Me**  

I’m actively seeking an internship or entry-level role as a front-end developer or software engineer.

Now, I’m taking my education to the next level by pursuing a **Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering**, deepening my technical expertise and addressing areas for growth.  

I believe in staying curious and committed to continuous improvement, always striving to push technology forward.
